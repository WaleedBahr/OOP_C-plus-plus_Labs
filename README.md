# ITI Labs: C++ OOP Labs

Welcome to the ITI Labs repository! This repository contains a series of labs conducted during a five-day program at the Information Technology Institute (ITI). These labs cover Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.

## Labs Overview

- **Day 1: C++ Basics**:
  - Introduction to C++ programming language.
  - Basic syntax, variables, and data types.
  - Functions
  - Control flow structures (if, else, loops).

- **Day 2: Classes and Objects**:
  - Introduction to classes and objects.
  - Encapsulation and access specifiers.

- **Day 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism**:
  - Understanding inheritance and polymorphism.
  - Implementing polymorphic behavior.

- **Day 4: Abstraction and Encapsulation**:
  - Deep dive into abstraction and encapsulation.
  - Practical implementation examples.

- **Day 5: Advanced OOP Concepts**:
  - Composition and aggregation.
  - Templates and generic programming.
  - Exception handling.
